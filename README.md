# The Go Programming Language

## Modified to emit warnings

This git commit modifies the go compiler to support emitting warnings instead of errors when it encounters unused labels, variables, and imports. Warnings do not stop compilation or production of the final binary.

All changes to the upstream go compiler are contained within this one commit. From time to time, I'll rebase this commit onto upstream master and force-push to https://github.com/kstenerud/go master in order to keep it clean and current.

## Use Case

The use case for warnings is the exploratory development or debugging phases, where you really don't care about leaving unused things lying around for the time being (for example, temporarily commenting something out), and would rather that the compiler just got out of your way until you've got something ready to compile normally and commit.



## Usage

    go build -gcflags=-warnunused somefile.go
    go test -gcflags=-warnunused

When you're done with your exploratory/debugging phase, simply build or test without the flag:

    go build somefile.go
    go test

Compiling without the flags will fail on unused things as normal.

### Example:

example.go:

```golang
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    var start int = 1

    breakOuter:
    // for x := start; x < 10; x++ {
    for x := 3; x < 10; x++ {
        for y := 0; y < 10; y++ {
            result := y * 10 + x
            // fmt.Printf("Result: %d\n", result)
            // if result == 42 {
            //  fmt.Printf("Breaking")
            //  break breakOuter
            // }
        }
    }
}
```

Result of `go build -gcflags=-warnunused example.go`:

    ./example.go:8:2: Warning: label breakOuter defined and not used
    ./example.go:3:8: Warning: imported and not used: "fmt"
    ./example.go:6:6: Warning: start declared and not used
    ./example.go:12:4: Warning: result declared and not used



## When will this go into mainline?

This feature will not be put into mainline golang: https://golang.org/doc/faq#unused_variables_and_imports



## Getting and Building the Modified Go Compiler

Download the source code, install a bootstrap compiler, and build!


### 1: Download and install the source code

#### Option A: Downloaded as a tag directly from github:

* Go to https://github.com/kstenerud/go/releases
* Select the latest `goX.Y.Z-warn` tag

#### Option B: Checked out of this git repository:

* `git tag` to get a list of tags
* `git checkout goX.Y.Z-warn`

The go tree must reside at /usr/local/go (according to https://golang.org/doc/install#install)

So for example: `sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.12.6-warn.tgz`


### 2: Download and install a bootstrap compiler

You can bootstrap from one of the official distributions at https://golang.org/dl

It must reside at `$HOME/go1.4`

For example:

    wget https://dl.google.com/go/go1.12.7.linux-amd64.tar.gz
    tar xf go1.12.7.linux-amd64.tar.gz
    mv go $HOME/go1.4


### 3: Copy over the bootstrap go tool

    mkdir -p /usr/local/go/bin
    cp $HOME/go1.4/bin/go /usr/local/go/bin/


### 4: Build the compiler

    cd /usr/local/go/src
    ./all.bash
    # or to build without running tests: ./make.bash

This will build the go compiler binaries and put them in `/usr/local/go`



## Applying this Patch to a Specific Go Release

To apply this change to a specific go release, simply checkout the tag, make a branch, cherry-pick this commit, and build.


### Release patching example

Get the tag to cherry-pick:

	$ git checkout master
    $ git log --oneline -n 1
    0e367a3c38 (HEAD -> master, origin/master, origin/HEAD) Support emitting warnings ...

Make a branch from your chosen tag and cherry-pick:

    git checkout go1.12.6
    git checkout -b go1.12.6-warn-branch
    git cherry-pick 0e367a3c38

Build the compiler and run tests:

    cd src
    ./all.bash

Make a new tag for your modified go compiler:

    git tag -a go1.12.6-warn



## Rebasing to upstream

To get the latest goodies from upstream and retain this patch:

    git pull --rebase https://github.com/golang/go.git master
    git fetch --tags https://github.com/golang/go.git



## Helper Script

Here's a quick script to create a modified branch of the go compiler:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

set -eu

if [[ ! $(git config --get remote.origin.url) =~ .*/go\.git$ ]]; then
    echo "This command must be run from inside the golang git repository"
    exit 1
fi

if [[ $# -ne 1 ]]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 <go release tag>"
    echo "Use git tag to get a list"
    exit 1
fi

GO_RELEASE_ORIGINAL_TAG=$1
GO_RELEASE_NEW_TAG=${GO_RELEASE_ORIGINAL_TAG}-warn
GO_RELEASE_BRANCH=${GO_RELEASE_NEW_TAG}-branch

git checkout master
WARNINGS_COMMIT=$(git rev-parse HEAD)

git checkout "$GO_RELEASE_ORIGINAL_TAG"
git checkout -b "$GO_RELEASE_BRANCH"
git cherry-pick $WARNINGS_COMMIT

echo "
New branch $GO_RELEASE_BRANCH created with warnings commit cherry-picked ($(git rev-parse HEAD))

Now you can build it:
    cd src
    ./all.bash or ./make.bash

When you're happy, tag it:
    git tag -a $GO_RELEASE_NEW_TAG
"
```
