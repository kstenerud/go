# The Go Programming Language

## Modified to emit warnings

This git commit modifies the go compiler to allow emitting warnings instead of errors when it encounters unused labels, variables, and imports. Warnings do not stop compilation or production of the final binary while the `-warnunused` flag is set. Omitting `-warnunused` will make compilation fail as normal on unused things.

**All changes to the upstream go compiler are contained within this one commit.** From time to time, I'll rebase this commit onto upstream master and force-push to https://github.com/kstenerud/go master in order to keep it clean and current.

## Use Case

The use case for warnings is the exploratory development or debugging phases, where you really don't care about leaving unused things lying around for the time being (for example, temporarily commenting something out), and would rather that the compiler just got out of your way until you've got something ready to compile normally and commit.

Without a warnings flag, temporarily commenting things out turns into a game of whack-a-mole, where what you commented out was the only thing using something else, which you must now also comment out, exposing yet another variable and some imports that now must also be commented out, ad adsurdum.


## Usage

    go build -gcflags=-warnunused somefile.go
    go test -gcflags=-warnunused

When you're done with your exploratory/debugging phase, simply build or test without the flag:

    go build somefile.go
    go test

Compiling without the flags will fail on unused things as normal.

### Example:

example.go:

```golang
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    var start int = 1

    breakOuter:
    // for x := start; x < 10; x++ {
    for x := 3; x < 10; x++ {
        for y := 0; y < 10; y++ {
            result := y * 10 + x
            // fmt.Printf("Result: %d\n", result)
            // if result == 42 {
            //  fmt.Printf("Breaking")
            //  break breakOuter
            // }
        }
    }
}
```

Result of `go build -gcflags=-warnunused example.go`:

    ./example.go:8:2: Warning: label breakOuter defined and not used
    ./example.go:3:8: Warning: imported and not used: "fmt"
    ./example.go:6:6: Warning: start declared and not used
    ./example.go:12:4: Warning: result declared and not used



## When will this go into mainline?

This feature will not be put into mainline golang: https://golang.org/doc/faq#unused_variables_and_imports



## Getting and Building the Modified Go Compiler

Download the source code, install a bootstrap compiler, and build!


### 1: Download and install the source code

#### Option A: Downloaded as a tag directly from github:

* Go to https://github.com/kstenerud/go/releases
* Select the latest `goX.Y.Z-warn` tag

#### Option B: Checked out of this git repository:

* `git tag` to get a list of tags
* `git checkout goX.Y.Z-warn`

The go tree must reside at /usr/local/go (according to https://golang.org/doc/install#install)

So for example: `sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.12.6-warn.tgz`


### 2: Download and install a bootstrap compiler

You can bootstrap from one of the official distributions at https://golang.org/dl

It must reside at `$HOME/go1.4`

For example:

```sh
wget https://dl.google.com/go/go1.12.7.linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar xf go1.12.7.linux-amd64.tar.gz
mv go $HOME/go1.4
```

### 3: Copy over the bootstrap go tool

```sh
mkdir -p /usr/local/go/bin
cp $HOME/go1.4/bin/go /usr/local/go/bin/
```

### 4: Build the compiler

```sh
cd /usr/local/go/src
./make.bash
```

This will build the go compiler binaries and put them in `/usr/local/go/bin`



## Applying this Patch to a Specific Go Release

To apply this change to a specific go release, simply checkout the release tag, make a branch, cherry-pick this commit, and build.


### Release patching example

Rebase to the golang team's latest upstream:

```sh
git pull --rebase https://github.com/golang/go.git master
git fetch --tags https://github.com/golang/go.git
```

Get the hash of the warnings commit (it's at the head):

```sh
git checkout master
git log --oneline -n 1
```

    0e367a3c38 (HEAD -> master, origin/master, origin/HEAD) Support emitting warnings ...

Make a branch from your chosen tag (for example 1.12.6) and cherry-pick:

```sh
git checkout go1.12.6
git checkout -b go1.12.6-warn-branch
git cherry-pick 0e367a3c38
```

Build the compiler:

```sh
cd src
./make.bash
```

Make a new release tag for your modified go compiler:

```sh
git tag -a go1.12.6-warn
```


## Tracking this Repository

Since all changes are kept in a single commit, this repository must be repeatedly force-pushed, which makes keeping up to date with this repository slightly more involved:

```sh
git fetch
git fetch --tags
git reset --hard origin/master
```

**Warning: this will destroy any local changes you've made to the repository!**



## Helper Script

Here's a quick script to put this change into a specific go release. If using the commit from from `master` (the default) causes conflicts, try using one from a previous `warn` tag instead. For example:

    make-go-patched-branch -s go1.13.3-warn go1.13.4

make-go-patched-branch:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

set -eu

if [[ ! $(git config --get remote.origin.url) =~ .*/go\.git$ ]]; then
    echo "This command must be run from inside the golang git repository"
    exit 1
fi

GO_RELEASE_SOURCE_TAG=master

show_help() {
    echo "Usage: $0 [options] <go release tag>"
    echo "Use git tag to get a list"
    echo
    echo "Options:"
    echo " -s <tag>: Use the commit from the specified warn tag instead of $GO_RELEASE_SOURCE_TAG (example: go1.13.4-warn)"
}

while getopts "s:" o; do
    case "$o" in
        s)
            GO_RELEASE_SOURCE_TAG=$OPTARG
            ;;
        *)
            show_help
            exit 1
            ;;
    esac
done
shift $((OPTIND-1))


if [[ $# -ne 1 ]]; then
    show_help
    exit 1
fi

GO_RELEASE_ORIGINAL_TAG=$1
GO_RELEASE_NEW_TAG=${GO_RELEASE_ORIGINAL_TAG}-warn
GO_RELEASE_BRANCH=${GO_RELEASE_NEW_TAG}-branch

git checkout $GO_RELEASE_SOURCE_TAG
WARNINGS_COMMIT=$(git rev-parse HEAD)

git checkout "$GO_RELEASE_ORIGINAL_TAG"
git checkout -b "$GO_RELEASE_BRANCH"
git cherry-pick $WARNINGS_COMMIT

echo "
New branch $GO_RELEASE_BRANCH created with warnings commit cherry-picked ($(git rev-parse HEAD))

Now you can build it:
    cd src
    ./all.bash or ./make.bash

When you're happy, tag it:
    git tag -a $GO_RELEASE_NEW_TAG
"
```
